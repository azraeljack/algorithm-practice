# Algorithm Practice
[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/yanpeili/yanpeili/_apis/build/status/azraeljack.algorithm-practice?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/yanpeili/yanpeili/_build/latest?definitionId=1?branchName=master)

Just a playground for testing algorithms and data structures, hopefully I can finish all of the following.

## Data Structures

- ### Implemented:
    
    - Stack (not tested)
    - Non-Blocking Queue (not tested)
    - Heap (not tested)

- ### WIP:

    - Binary Search Tree
    - Concurrent Map
    - Hash Map
    - Directed Acyclic Graph
    - Blocking Queue
    - Hash List
    - Linked List
    - Radix Tree
    - Red Black Tree
    - Patricia Trie
    - Bloom Bits filter (probably this shouldn't be here, but anyway)

## Sorting Algorithms

- ### Implemented:
    
    - Quick Sort
    - Bubble Sort
    - Bucket Sort
    
- ### WIP:

    - Block Sort
    - Clover Sort
    - Heap Sort
    - Binary Tree Sort
    - Merge Sort
    - Insertion Sort

## Algorithm Problems (will be mainly leetcode stuffs and interview problems)

- Will create the contents later
