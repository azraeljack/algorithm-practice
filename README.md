# Algorithm Practice
[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/yanpeili/yanpeili/_apis/build/status/azraeljack.algorithm-practice?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/yanpeili/yanpeili/_build/latest?definitionId=1?branchName=master)
[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/azraeljack/algorithm-practice)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/azraeljack/algorithm-practice)

Just a playground for testing algorithms and data structures. The code here may not be the best practice but hopefully I can finish all of the following.

## Data Structures

- ### Implemented:
    
    - Heap
    - Stack
    - Non-Blocking Queue (not tested)
    - LRU (not tested)

- ### WIP:

    - Binary Search Tree
    - Skip List
    - Concurrent Map
    - Hash Map
    - Directed Acyclic Graph
    - Blocking Queue
    - Hash List
    - Linked List
    - Radix Tree
    - Red Black Tree
    - Bloom Bits Filter (probably this shouldn't be here, but anyway)

## Sorting Algorithms

- ### Implemented:
    
    - Quick Sort
    - Bubble Sort
    - Count Sort
    - Heap Sort
    - Merge Sort
    - Insertion Sort
    
- ### WIP:
    
    - Bucket Sort
    - Block Sort
    - Clover Sort
    - Binary Tree Sort

## Algorithm Problems (will be mainly Leetcode stuffs and interview problems)

- Will create the contents later
